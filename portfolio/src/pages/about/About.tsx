            I am a Creative Technologist and Design Researcher, interested in
            the connection between the physical and digital world. I research,
            explore, prototype and develop new modalities of interactions using
            research through design and experience prototyping methodologies. I
            love translating (often) abstract and ambiguous user needs and
            wishes into straightforward interaction requirements for tech teams.
            My work is multidisciplinary and diverse as are the projects, topics
            and teams I work in.
