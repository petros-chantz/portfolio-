# Petros Chantzopoulos - Portfolio 2022

Build with React, Tailwind, AWS, Figma and a ton of help from ClickUp which helped with prioritisiation of features.

I'm not a fun of tacky animations or flashy, cheesy, over-the-top colorful UIs with the dreadfully over-rounded element borders.
I'll always advocate for "Less is More" and for expertise to shine in developing meanindful interactions.

See something you believe needs improvement? Do you want to give me some feedback or a suggestion? Write an issue!
I'll check it out! As always if you know something that can help someone improve their skills, share it! Don't be afraid ;)
