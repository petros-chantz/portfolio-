            I am a Creative Technologist and Design Researcher, interested in
            the connection between the physical and digital world. I research,
            explore, prototype and develop new modalities of interactions using
            research through design and experience prototyping methodologies. I
            love translating (often) abstract and ambiguous user needs and
            wishes into straightforward interaction requirements for tech teams.
            My work is multidisciplinary and diverse as are the projects, topics
            and teams I work in.

            There, I'm leading design research initiatives by examining and
            evaluating our product experiences, as well as inquiring new wishes
            and demands from our clients and stakeholders. As a UX Developer,
            Iâ€™m also heavily involved in the development of our front-end web
            applications. I'm working together with other application developers
