          I am a Creative Technologist and Design Researcher, interested in the
          connection between the physical and digital world. I research,
          explore, prototype and develop new modalities of interactions using
          research through design and experience prototyping methodologies. I
          love translating (often) abstract and ambiguous user needs and wishes
          into straightforward interaction requirements for tech teams. My work
          is multidisciplinary and diverse as are the projects, topics and teams
          I work in.

          There, I'm leading design research initiatives by examining and
          evaluating our product experiences, as well as inquiring new wishes
          and demands from our clients and stakeholders. As a UX Developer, Iâ€™m
          also heavily involved in the development of our front-end web
          applications. I'm working together with other application developers
          delivering new product features and creating new design systems for
          upcoming projects.
